This is the MudOS release.  The current release is available from
TMI (ftp dogstar.colorado.edu 5554) in /pub/gamedrivers/MudOS.

MudOS is based on Lars' LPmud 3.0 gamedriver but contains numerous
enhancements and is somewhat different.  We decided to change the name
to minimize confusion (so that people wouldn't expect to be able to use
our version to run LPmud 3.0 compatible mudlibs unchanged).  As of
MudOS version 0.8.9, MudOS incorporates Lars patches up through 3.1.2.

If you are inclined toward hacking the gamedriver, you may wish to read the
./doc/done-lars and ./doc/done-mudos files for more information on
what changes have been made.  You may also wish to login to TMI mud
(dogstar.colorado.edu 5555) and check out the Gamedriver Guild (this
is where the people who work on the MudOS gamedriver meet).

This distribution contains:

README - this file

VERSION - a file which has the current version of this release.

src - a directory containing the source code

doc - documentation for the driver (not very much yet)

mudlib - example files which are required for your mudlib

bin - directory containing support shell scripts (like: restart_mud)

To get started, first read the applicable docs in the ./doc subdirectory
(you might start with the './doc/install' file).

Assuming you have read the 'install' file and have installed the gamedriver
and your mudlib, the simple way to get started is to type:

./driver config.example >! ~/usr/mud/mudlib/log/lpmud.log &

(where, of course, you have changed the path to reflect your environment)

To start the game in such a way that it will automatically restart
after crashes, run ./bin/restart_mud as a background process.  Be sure
to kill this process if you want the game to keep from automatically
coming back up.

If you make changes to the driver source code, you will want to type
'make depend' once before rebuilding the driver (however, this isn't
absolutely necessary).
