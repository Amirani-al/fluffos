MudOS is an LPmud server (driver) which was originally distributed as an
enhanced version of the LPmud 3.x driver.  It does not support COMPAT mode,
but a number of newer mudlibs are available.
 
This distribution contains the source code (written in C) to MudOS in the 
./src subdirectory, documentation in ./doc, configuration files in ./etc, a 
small sample mudlib in ./mudlib, and a few utility scripts in ./bin.
 
Begin by reading all of the remaining files in this directory (most 
importantly, the "Copyright" file).  Continue by reading the information in 
the ./doc subdirectory (i.e. Install and Run).
