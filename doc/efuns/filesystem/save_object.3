.SH NAME
save_object() - save the values of variables in an object into a file

.SH SYNOPSIS
void save_object(string name, int flag)

.SH DESCRIPTION
Save all values of variables of this object in the file "name".
It is illegal to have '.' or space in the field name.  The valid_write()
function in master.c determines whether or not the save_object is allowed
to write the save file.  If the optional second argument is 1, then variables
that are zero (0) are also saved (normally, they aren't).

.SH SEE ALSO
restore_object(3).
