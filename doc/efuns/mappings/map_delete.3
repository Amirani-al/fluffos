.SH NAME
map_delete() - remove a (key, value) pair from a mapping based on the key

.SH SYNOPSIS
void map_delete(mapping m, mixed element)

.SH DESCRIPTION
map_delete removes the (key, value) from the mapping m that has key equal
to element.
.PP
For example, given:
.IP
.nf
mapping names;

names = ([]);
names["truilkan"] = "john";
names["wayfarer"] = "erik";
names["jacques"] = "dwayne";
.PP
Then:
.IP
map_delete(names,"truilkan");
.PP
causes the mapping 'names' to be equal to:
.IP
(["wayfarer" : "erik", "jacques" : "dwayne"])
.PP
.fi
keys(names) will not contain "truilkan" after map_delete(names,"truilkan")
is called [unless ("truilkan", *) is subsequently added back to the mapping].
