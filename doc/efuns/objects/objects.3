.SH NAME
objects - return an array of all loaded objects
 
.SH SYNOPSIS
object *objects();
 
.SH DESCRIPTION
An array of every object loaded on the mud is returned by objects().  Note
that if the system's maximum array size is set too low, objects() will
truncate its array, in which case it might not be too useful.
