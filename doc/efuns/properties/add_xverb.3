.SH NAME
add_xverb() - add a verb that doesn't require a trailing separate space

.SH SYNOPSIS
void add_xverb(string str);

.SH DESCRIPTION
Similar to add_verb except that the verb is recognized even if not
separated from the rest of the sentence by a space.  This function
is useful when implementing the usual abbreviation ' for say
and : for emote.
.PP
This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly with
add_action(). add_xverb() remains for compatibility.

.SH SEE ALSO
add_action(3), add_verb(3).
