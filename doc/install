This is a brief description of how to install MudOS 0.8.13 (or later)
using native mode (NOT 2.4.5 compatibility mode).

The remainder of this document assumes that you are installing the
mud in $HOME (you can install it wherever you like).

Make a the following directories in $HOME: bin, MudOS, and MudOS/src.

Get a native mudlib.  The easiest way to do this is copy the TMI mudlib from
dogstar.colorado.edu.  You can ftp it from port 5554 (e.g. type:
ftp dogstar.colrado.edu 5554).  Login under your game character name (using
your game character password) or as ftp or anonymous.  Switch (cd) to
the /pub/mudlibs/tmi directory.  The latest version of the TMI mudlib
will be in this directory.  Switch to binary mode (type: binary) and
then type: get filename.  The file will be in tar.Z format.  Make sure
you have the tar.Z file saved in the $HOME directory.  To extract
the mudlib from this file, type:

zcat filename.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

Move the gamedriver source (the code accompanying this file)
to the MudOS/src directory.  Move the example access.allow file from the
./mudlib directory to $HOME/MudOS/d/TMI/local/adm/etc/access.allow.

Edit the Makefile to define where the mud bin directory is by setting a
value for INSTALL_DIR.  Again you should specify the full path
$HOME/bin.

Specify in config.h which malloc package you would like to use.
If you are using a NeXT or an RS/6000, do not choose SMALLOC (it won't
link, you'll be wasting your time... hack away if you like but consider
yourself forewarned).  Also, be sure to read README.malloc if you
decide to hack on any of the malloc code.  The SYSMALLOC choice should
work on any machine.

An example defaults file may be found in ./mudlib directory (created when
MudOS is untarred) under the name config.example.  The TMI mudlib will
come with its own example config file.  You should be able to use that
config file by making minor modifications.  The config file should be
stored in $HOME/MudOS/d/TMI/local/adm/etc/config.

You may use CONFIG_FILE_DIR in config.h specify a directory in which the
driver will search for config files.

Also, check the rest of the definitions in config.h; most are probably good
as they are but you will probably need to change some of them.

Cd to the $HOME/MudOS/src/MudOS-0.8.13/src directory and type:

make install

This will build the gamedriver binary and it will move it to the
$HOME/bin directory.

Start the mud by typing:

./driver $HOME/d/TMI/local/adm/etc/config.example

[or start it by typing: "./driver config.example" if you used CONFIG_FILE_DIR]

You should see something like this:

MudOS driver 0.8.13
Setting up IPC.

Test with 'telnet localhost 3000'.

If you want the game to restart automatically after it is shutdown or
crashes (nah.. it never crashes, does it? *grin*), start the mud with
'bin/restart_mud' instead of "./driver".
