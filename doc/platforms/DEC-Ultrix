MudOS hints for DECStation Ultrix:

in the Makefile,
 you'll need to uncomment UALARM_C and UALARM_O
 make sure RESOLV is commented out
 use smalloc for best memory performance

MudOS seems to compile fine with the system's cc.  Use -O2 for maximum
optimization.

Not tested (by me) with gcc.

Ultrix 4.2 (at least) yacc won't work.  You'll need bison.
