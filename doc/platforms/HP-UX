MudOS hints file for HP-UX:

in the Makefile,
 comment out RESOLV
 uncomment UALARM_C and UALARM_O
 for maximum optimization with cc, use: OPTIMIZE=+O3 +Obb3000
 uncomment EXTRALIBS=-lBSD

HP-UX's malloc performs terribly in profiles, you should probably use
smalloc or bsdmalloc.

Varargs doesn't function properly in gcc 2.2 for HP (and possibly later
versions of gcc will be messed up as well).  Part of the MudOS driver
depends on varargs (the vprintf).  Either use HP's cc or undefine
VARARGS in port.h.
