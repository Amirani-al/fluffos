MudOS hints for HP-UX:
 
in the Makefile,
 make sure RESOLV is commented out
 uncomment UALARM_C and UALARM_O
 uncomment EXTRALIBS=-lBSD
 use smalloc for best memory/speed performance--system malloc is way slow
 
PA-RISC machines (at least):
 MudOS runs fine compiled with cc under HP-UX 7.x and 8.x.  It does not work
  with 9.0x's cc.  
 With cc, use OPTIMIZE=+O3 +Obb3000 for maximum optimization.
 gcc (as of 2.2.x) does not support varargs on the HP--the file that uses
  varargs, comm.c, must be compiled _separately_ with cc (comm.c is OK
  with 9.0x's cc).  Ignore this if you have a newer version of gcc that
  is OK with varargs on HP-UX.  You know you don't if you get an error
  at link time mentioning something like "__builtin_varargs undefined".
