This version of ftpd was originally modified to work with LPmuds
by Shimrod@Overdrive.

The following modifications were made by Truilkan@TMI:

- minor cleanup of the code (typecasts etc to get rid of compiler warnings)
- separated out valid_read and valid_write into a new module valid.c
- moved all dependencies on mudlib directory structure into valid.c
- wrote valid.c in such a way that its compatible with the TMI mudlib
  (as of January 22, 1992)
- added anonymous ftp support (login as ftp, anonymous, or guest)

The following modifications were made by Gunther@Dragons_Den:

- modified valid.c so it is compatible with Dragon's Den's mudlib.
- removed code for TMI's position variable
- added a new variable to have the players access priviliges saved and checked
  in the valid_read() and valid_write() functions.
- added code for using a config.h instead of security.h
- prevented players from logging in.

Done to valid.c :

- added code for dependancy on level
- added code for domain specific ftp's
- added defines including ability to set your domain and wizard directories.
- coded the access_allowed() function to check a file in /secure in the mudlib
  called FTP_ACCESS
- coded valid_write() and valid_read() functions to check the access variable
  of the player defined by the access_allowed() function. 

The port number for ftpd, mudlib directory, wizard directory, anonymous ftp,
domains, and level restrictions can be set in config.h.


Note: any normal ftp client program can access this ftp daemon.  Thus
there is no need for wizards to get a special client (like mtp) before
they can transfer files (since most users already have access to ftp).

Suppose the port number is set to 5554.  Then anyone can access this
ftp daemon by typing:

ftp dogstar.colorado.edu 5554

(replace dogstar.colorado.edu with the name of the host running ftpd).
