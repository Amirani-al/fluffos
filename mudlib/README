Nightmare (jericho.connected.com 6000) mudlib is available.  Also, the 
Portals mudlib may eventually be released.  If you have developed a MudOS 
mudlib that is publically available, please send email to 
mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu letting us know where to obtain it (so that
we may include a reference to it in a future release of MudOS).
