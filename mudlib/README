Since TMI-2 has released its beta mudlib (tmi.iastate.edu 5555) and since
Basis is available elsewhere (basis-19.tar.Z), we have decided to
discontinue including the mini-Basis mudlib with MudOS.  The Nightmare
creators also reportedly plan to release a publically available mudlib
(orlith.bates.edu 2999).  Also, the Portals mudlib may eventually be
released.  If you have developed a MudOS mudlib that you wish to make
publically available, please send email to mudos-bugs@gestalt.austin.tx.us
letting us know where to obtain it (so that we may include a reference
to it in a future release of MudOS).

TMI-2 is available via anonymous ftp (login as ftp) from
tmi.iastate.edu 5554:/pub/mudlibs (yes, ftp to the port).
