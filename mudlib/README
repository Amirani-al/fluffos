TMI-2 (tmi.ccs.neu.edu 5555) has released its mudlib.  The Nightmare 
(jericho.connected.com 6000) mudlib is also available.  If you have 
developed a MudOS mudlib that is publically available, please send email to 
mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu letting us know where to obtain it (so 
that we may include a reference to it in a future release of MudOS).
 
TMI-2 is available via anonymous ftp (login as ftp) from 
ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/mudlibs.
 
Nightmare is available via anonymous ftp from jericho.connected.com 5999.
