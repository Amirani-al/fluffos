TMI-2 (tmi.ccs.neu.edu 5555) has released its mudlib.  The Nightmare
(nightmare.connected.com 4000) mudlib is also available.  If you have
developed a MudOS mudlib that is publically available, please send email to
mudos-bugs@actlab.rtf.utexas.edu letting us know where to obtain it (so
that we may include a reference to it in a future release of MudOS).
 
TMI-2 is available via anonymous ftp (login as ftp) from
ftp.ccs.neu.edu:/pub/mud/mudlibs.
 
Nightmare is available via anonymous ftp from nightmare.connected.com 3999.
