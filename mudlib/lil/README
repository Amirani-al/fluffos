This directory contains a very minimal mudlib named Lil intended for use in
bootstrapping a mudlib to be built from scratch.  Anyone who has attempted
to build a mudlib from the ground up knows that the most painful part is
getting the mudlib to the point where the driver will boot up and accept
logins.  After this point, its much easier to debug objects because the
driver is actually available to compile the objects and provide feedback
about what might be wrong!  Lil is provided to allow that first painful
step to be avoided (useful learning experience though it may be).  Also,
we felt that providing a driver that won't run out of the box (and it won't
run without a mudlib) is a bit silly.  Yet we didn't want to provide a full
mudlib because we'd rather see many different mudlibs rather than just
variations on a single mudlib (also, there are several complete
MudOS mudlibs available and there isn't any good way to choose which
one we would include).
