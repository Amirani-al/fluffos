Wed Apr 22 21:43:21 CDT 1992 Truilkan@TMI
	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.14
	* added the CONFIG_FILE_DIR back to config.h due to popular demand
	* mucked some with prototypes that were giving some people problems
	* added in Wayf's changes to GNUmakefile
	* split CALL_EXIT into ROOM_CALL_EXIT and ALL_CALL_EXIT (see config.h
	  for details)
	* added a fix to ed.c to prevent driver from dumping core when
	  ed displays way long lines. (whiplash@TMI reported this)

Tue Apr 14 14:19:36 CDT 1992 Truilkan@TMI
	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.13
	* changed name of do_message() efun back to message() (turns out that
	  only the name of the function called from inside the F_MESSAGE case
	  in interpret.c needed to be changed to do_message()).
	* fixed a bug in call_all_other in interpret.c (pushing same value onto
	  stack numargs times)
	* fixed another bug in call_all_other (wasn't popping right number
	  of things off the stack).
	* added Shadowhawk's dprint option to ed.c (automatic print after delete)
	* added tell_npc(ob,str) back to end of object.c:tell_object (was
	  mistakenly removed a few releases back).  -- Soulsinger@Dreamshadow
	  noticed this one.
	* changed svalue_to_int in mapping.c to explicitly handle T_OBJECT
	* applied Wayf's fix to simulate.c so that the failed to load file
	  message is specific.
	* added Darker Realm's interpret.c:F_ADD fix for a memory leak
	* added a fix to keep error messages generated by clean_up from going
	  to a random player (whoever happens to be this_player() at the time).
	* changed a the wording of a few error messages to make more sense
	* added object type O_MASTER.  fixed validate_shadowing so it will not
	  allow shadowing of the master object (previously this had to be
	  explicitly prevented in master.c itself).
	* changed all malloc's to MALLOC's and free's to FREE's etc.
	  so that stats can be kept on system malloc and so that smalloc.
	  can be used on machines that don't allow malloc to be redefined.
	  Any additions to the driver should not use malloc(), free(), realloc(),
	  or calloc().  Instead use the capitalized versions of these.  Any
	  c module using these should include both config.h and lint.h in
	  that order.  The desired memory package must now be specified in
	  config.h.  Added make_malloc.c.
	* added a link(string,string) efun to do UNIX links.  queries
	  valid_ln(string source,string target) in master.c.
	* fixed F_SHUTDOWN in interpret.c so that it actually pays attention
	  to the value returned by valid_shutdown in master.c
	* enhanced sizeof() to work on mappings as well.  Because of the
	  implementation of mappings this efun is really only useful to see
	  whether or not a mapping has just been set to ([]).
	  e.g. if (!sizeof(mapping)) do_something();
	* cleaned up the shared string hash table data structure.
	* modified object_present() in simulate.c so that if OLD_PRESENT isn't
	  #defined, the present() efun behaves in a new way.  If present calls
	  id() in an object and id() returns an object, then present will
	  return the object returned to it by id().  The potential uses for
	  this are left up to the imagination of the reader (oh well... ok.
	  You could use it to make a charmed monster that made you attack someone
	  else in the room whenever you tried to attack it.   You could also
	  use it to make a chair that let you look at whoever was inside it by
	  typing "look at joe" or whoever).  -- this one was at the request of
	  Jubal@TMI.
	* added conditional code to move_object so that if CALL_EXIT is
	  defined in config.h, then move_object will call the "exit" method
	  in objects in the inverse manner in which "init" is called.
	  That is, when a living object leaves a room, it will call "exit"
	  on the room and on each living object in the room.  Each living
	  in the room will also call "exit" on the living leaving the room.
	  This is expensive and so it is optional.  This functionality
	  was added at the request of Dainia@Dreamshadow.
	* fixed a bug in F_RECEIVE (wasn't saving command_giver).  This lets
	  INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL be safely defined in config.h.  Defining
	  INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL causes tell_object to call catch_tell in
	  interactives.  The catch_tell can call receive(str) to display
	  the message to the interactive.
	* changed driver so that everything goes to catch_tell if
	  INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL is defined (shouts, says, tell, room tells).
	  Also changed things so that monsters get shouts via catch_tell.

Mon Apr 13 13:40:27 CDT 1992 Truilkan@TMI

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.12
	* changed comm1.c so that FIONBIO isn't used for sun3's.  some number of
      them seem not to be able to handle that ioctl.
	* fixed in_input and in_edit in interpret.c to pop the stack like they
	  should (Pariah@TMI found this one).

Sun Apr 12 20:55:26 CDT 1992 Truilkan@TMI

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.11
	* fixed set_bit, test_bit, and clear_bit so that they work and produce
	  printable strings once again (somebody mucked with them)
	* refixed bug causing game to consider ! an escape even when not in
	  ed or input_to (somehow this fix was lost)
	* added Vincent's Hollow's patch to lex. to allow token pasting (using ##)

Sun Apr 12 04:56:56 CDT 1992  Truilkan@TMI

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.10
	* updated the installation documentation in ./README and ./doc/install

Sat Apr 11

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.9
	* no real changes (fixed a problem that was causing patches to
	the Makefile to be rejected -- Buddha's makefile was out of sync with
	the one I was using). 

Sat Apr 11 03:59:46 CDT 1992  Truilkan@TMI

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.8
	* renamed delete() to be map_delete() and fixed a bug in the
	F_MAP_DELETE case of interpret.c.

Thu Apr  9 22:55:49 CDT 1992  Truilkan@TMI

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.7
	* refixed save_object so that it can save 2-d mappings
	* changed reset_object so that it undefines this_player while reset is
	  called (so that charlie brown doesn't get snoopy's error messages).

Thu Mar  5 00:13:55 CST 1992  Truilkan@TMI
 
 	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.6
 	* added Lars 3.1.1-3.1.2 diffs (the one that we hadn't already found)
 	* added efun undefinedp().  This was added to
 	make it unnecessary to overload zero (0) to mean two different things
 	(zero and/or undefined). call_other()'s on nonexistant methods
 	return undefined (const0u) and map references on keys not in map return
 	undefined (const0u).  This is, the value returned by a call_other on
 	a nonexistant method will caused undefinedp(value) to return TRUE etc.
 	* modified the makefile (not gnu makefile) to move y.tab.h to lang.tab.h
 	and y.tab.c to lang.tab.c (to be compatible with the GNU makefile).
 	* fixed a bug in backend.c just after process_input was called
	(was accessing ret->type even when ret was NULL) - Wayf found this one.
	* changed Huthar's message() to be do_message() (at request of Wayfarer)
 	* changed call_out.c so that call_out's are legal on static methods
 	(added code that temporarily changes current_object).
 	* added delete(map,element) which deletes an element from a map
 	* fixed save_object so that it can save 2-d mappings

Wed Mar  4 21:33:09 1992  Erik Kay  (erikkay at panacea.media.mit.edu)

	* removed all RCS stuff from the driver.  The current
	implementation sucks, so we'll take it out until it's rewritten
	better.

	* bumped the patchlevel number to 0.8.5

	* added two new efuns to the driver courtesy of Huthar of Portals
	and TMI.  children(object): returns all objects which were cloned
	from the object you pass to it, and message (string msg, string
	class,	mixed targets, object *exclude_targets).  This efun is a
	generic messaging function meant to replace all current
	communication efuns in the future (say, shout, tell_*, printf,
	write, etc).  It communicates directly to catch_tell in the
	targets.

	* added the file GNUmakefile to the dist which allows GNU make to
	be used with some greater flexibility in the compile cycle.

	* added support to allow yacc to be replaced with bison if so
	desired. 

	* fixed a couple of parser bugs in postlang.y revealed by using
	bison. 

	* cleaned up a number of warning messages generated by gcc 2.0.

	* cleaned up the Makefile still more. (there was a lot of useless
	stuff in it)

	* merged in Truilkan's fix to the memory leak in indices(), that was
	causing extra arrays to sit around.

Sat Feb 22 14:28:35 1992  Erik Kay  (erikkay at panacea.media.mit.edu)

	* made addition so that crash() could be defined static in
	master.c so that users can't do a call_other on it.

	* fixed the bug which screwed up the swap file location if you had
	a leading space.  It's now a file relative to the mudlib's home.

	* removed all dependance on query_player_level from the driver.
	It is now no longer needed in master.c.  (trace and traceprefix
	use O_IS_WIZARD)

	* changed the call to query_allow_shadow to valid_shadow to be
	more consistant with master.c naming conventions.

	* changed the apply of get_wiz_name in wiz_list.c to creator_file
	so that we don't have to have two functions which do exactly the
	same thing.

	* made set_inc_list happen before the master object is loaded so
	that the master object doesn't have to use explicit path names in
	it's #includes.

	* made simul_efun load before the master object so that the master
	object doesn't have to inherit simul_efun.

Fri Feb 21 18:30:36 1992  Erik Kay  (erikkay at panacea.media.mit.edu)

	* Added make depend instructions to the README file.

	* Fixed bug in rlog which caused the driver to dump core.  RCS
	should work (at least partially) now.

	* Commented out interactive catch tell code, since it's dumping
	the driver.  No clue on this one guys.

	* Took out all #ifdef LPCA and #ifndef LPCA since we always want
	that behavior.

	* Redid the Makefile to use makedepend.  Took -DLPCA out of the
	makefile as well as TRACE_CODE.

Thu Feb 20 00:35:40 CST 1992 Truilkan@TMI [0.8.2]

    * Added #include "config.h" to port.c so that the chosen random
    number generator will be used (instead of the default bad one).
    This corrects a bug introduced when -DRANDOM was moved out of
    the Makefile and into config.h.

    * fixed a bug in lex.c related to the C++ // style comments that
    could cause an infinite loop under certain circumstances.

    * added a #define INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL to config.h which should
    be defined if you want catch_tell to be called on interactives as
    well as NPCs (you'll need to define a catch_tell that calls receive()
    if you use this option).

    * Figured out why dumpallobj was crashing the mud.  It was because
    dumpstat.c wasn't grokking the T_MAPPING type (32).  I added
    a couple of empty cases to the switch statement to prevent crashing
    but Whiplash needs to go in and add code for those cases.

    * updated the doc/install file.


Tue Feb 18 18:51:57 1992  Erik Kay  (erikkay at dearth.media.mit.edu) [0.8.1]

	* commented out dumpallobj until we can fix it.

	* Made enable_wizard() require that the caller be interactive.  It
	now returns 1 on success, and 0 on failure.

	* Removed ETCDIR from the Makefile, and replaced it with
	CONFIG_FILE_DIR in config.h.  Put an explanation around it, so that
	there was no confusion as to its purpose.

	* Changed the config variable "include directories" so that it no
	longer needs the /%s on the trailing end.  So instead of /sys/%s,
	you can have /sys instead.
