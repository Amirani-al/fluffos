*Send mail to mudos-bugs@gestalt.austin.tx.us if you experience any
problems compiling or running on these systems.  Note that some of
these machines have old versions of yacc and do require bison (a
yacc replacement) to compile MudOS correctly.  If you manage to
compile and run MudOS on a system other than one listed here,
please send the diffs along with machine and OS information to the
mudos-bugs address.
