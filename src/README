MudOS is an enhanced LPmud 3.0 (native mode only).

This is the source (src) directory from the MudOS-0.9.x distribution.
Intermediate releases of MudOS (those with four components to the version
number) are typically released without documentation and other supporting
material (since the size of this other material is fairly large).  Releases
of MudOS with version numbers having three components will usually be
released as a combined source/documentation package (e.g. MudOS-0.9.15.tar.Z
will be the next such release).

Notes:

Send bug reports to mudos-bugs@gestalt.austin.tx.us.  Be sure to include
relevant information along with the problem description including:
Type of machine (e.g. Sun3, NeXT, RS/6000, etc), operating system
(e.g. SunOS 4.1, NeXTSTEP 3.0, AIX 3.2, etc), and version of MudOS
(e.g. 0.9.14.17).  Include any other information you feel may help.

Send mail to mudos-info-request@gestalt.austin.tx.us to be added to
the MudOS information mailing list (info on new releases etc).

Discuss the MudOS driver on the mudos@iastate.edu mailing list
(request to be added at mudos-request@iastate.edu).

ChangeLog.0 and ChangeLog.1 are no longer part of the src directory
(although the most recent ChangeLog will be retained).  The older ChangeLogs
will be kept in the documentation directory.

The 'addr_server' file replaces the old hname program.  Unlike hname,
addr_server must be started up manually (it takes a single argument
which is the port # the addr_server should listen on -- this port #
must also be specified in the runtime config file).

Some older versions of yacc will not build lang.y correctly (they complain
about "too many terminals".  If your yacc has this problem, you will need
to build lang.tab.* (from lang.y) on another machine or you will need
to get bison (a yacc replacement) from prep.ai.mit.edu in /pub/gnu (via
anonymous ftp).  If you build yacc on a different machine be sure to
configure options.h in the same way and make sure to add -DSYMBOL to
CFLAGS in the Makefile where SYMBOL is the symbol that your C preprocessor
automatically defines (e.g. NeXT, _AIX, hpux, linux, _AUX_SOURCE, etc).
Look in port.h at the ARCH defines if you don't know what symbol to use.
